# Callenge Cognativ

## About

This project is a very basic project used to evaluate your approach on re-order y refactor of javascript code and your basic knowledge in React Native
## Required tasks

* Run the app correctly on both iOS & Android environment
* Install react-navigation
* Configure the navigation to support List of recipes (Home) -> Recipe details (Details), navigating one to the other
* Re-write the 2 class component (Home & Details) as funcional components and move the lifecycle logic to appropriates hooks (if needed)
* Re-organize the code of the 2 screens in a more appropiate and readable way, following YOUR OWN criteria. 
* Connect to the api: https://virated-api.herokuapp.com/recipes instead of the fake data (for example using axios)

## Nice to have

* Write down some unit tests to achieve coding coverage > 70%
* Reorganize your code to use a state manager (MobX & Recoil will be preferred but Redux or other alternatives will be considered valid, but please Keep It Stupid Simple)
